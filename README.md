# Inventory Management System

## I. Project Overview
The Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to help users manage inventory efficiently, specifically to help the Konica Photo Express business. It provides functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory items, as well as generating bills for purchases. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built using Tkinter, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## II. Application of Python Concepts and Libraries
This project utilizes several key Python concepts and libraries:
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application, allowing users to interact with the system easily.
- **SQLite3**: A lightweight database used to store inventory data and transaction records, enabling persistent data management.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Used for image processing, allowing the application to display images in the GUI.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The application is structured using classes to encapsulate functionality related to inventory management, such as `InventoryPage`, `BillWindow`, and `Cart`.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented to manage exceptions and provide user feedback, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## III. Chosen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
This project aligns with **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**. By providing an efficient inventory management system, it encourages businesses to optimize their resource use, reduce waste, and promote sustainable practices. The application helps users track inventory levels, manage stock efficiently, and minimize overproduction, contributing to more sustainable consumption patterns.
